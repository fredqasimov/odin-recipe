            <li><h2>Step 1</h2>
                <ul><li><p>Put the oil in a deep skillet or large saucepan over medium-high heat. When itâ€™s hot, add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes.</p></li></ul></li>
            <li><h2>Step 2</h2>
                <ul><li><p>Add the rice and cook, stirring, until glossy, about 1 minute. Add the stock or water and a good sprinkling of salt and pepper and bring to a boil.</p></li></ul></li>
            <li><h2>Step 3</h2>
                <ul><li><p>Turn the heat down to low, cover and cook until the rice is tender and the liquid is almost entirely absorbed, about 15 minutes. Uncover, remove from the heat and stir in the herbs. Replace the lid and let rest off the heat for at least 10 minutes or up to 20 minutes. Uncover and stir in the lemon zest; taste and adjust the seasoning. Fluff the pilaf with a fork, and serve warm or at room temperature with a drizzle of soy sauce.</p></li></ul></li>
